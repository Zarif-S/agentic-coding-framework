# Project Plan - Tactical Execution

## 📍 Breadcrumbs

- **New to the project?** → [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md) for setup and overview
- **Looking for strategic vision?** → [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)
- **Looking for implementation details?** → [CLAUDE.md - Task Navigation](CLAUDE.md#-documentation-navigation)
- **Looking for completed features?** → [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md)

## Purpose of This Document

**For AI Agents**: Understand current priorities and context before implementing features. You'll create your own task-level breakdown using TodoWrite.

**For Humans**: High-level status overview bridging ROADMAP strategy to execution tools (GitHub Issues, Jira, etc.).

**PROJECT_PLAN.md** focuses on **what** and **when**:
- **What** are we building/doing right now?
- **When** is this happening? (now / next / later)
- **Who** is responsible? (optional, useful for delegation)

**This is NOT**:
- Task-level tracking (GitHub Issues/Jira handle this)
- Strategic vision (see [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md))
- Implementation details (see [CLAUDE.md](CLAUDE.md))

**Timeframe**: Current focus + next 1-2 months, reviewed weekly or biweekly

---

## Current Focus ([Month Year])

**Theme**: [What we're focused on - e.g., "Baseline Model Development" or "Multi-tenant Foundation"]

**Strategic Alignment**: Supports [ROADMAP milestone - e.g., "Q1 2025: Establish ML pipeline foundation"]

## For AI Agents

When you're asked to implement a feature:

1. **Read this document** to understand current focus and alignment
2. **Check blockers** to avoid working on blocked items
3. **Use TodoWrite** to create your own task-level breakdown
4. **Work incrementally** through your tasks, marking complete as you go
5. **Update documentation** when your work is done (CHANGELOG, CLAUDE.md if architecture changed)

Your task lists are ephemeral (conversation-level). This document stays high-level.
